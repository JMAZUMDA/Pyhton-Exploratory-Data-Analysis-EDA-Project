# Pyhton-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
This project analyzes public procurement tender data to uncover trends and insights through data cleaning, visualization, and simple regression analysis. It highlights key aspects like procurement categories, top procuring departments, tender value distribution, and monthly tender activity over time. 
The final output is a clear and interactive dashboard built using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, making the data easy to understand even for non-technical users.
